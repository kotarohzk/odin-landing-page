# Odin Landing Page

This is the second project of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) where we are required to apply what we have learned from the CSS sections in building a simple landing page with a common layout. Things that I have learned:

- using flexbox for layout
- using flex-direction to change orientation of main axis
- using flex-grow to change how flex-items grow when there is extra space
- using gap to spread flex-items apart instead of margin
- using justify-content and align-items to control space distribution and alignment along main and cross axes
- using psuedo-element, positioning and transform to create an animated underline when links are hovered over
